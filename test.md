| **Natural Language Testing**         | Write tests in plain English: "Go to the login page, fill the credentials, and check if the dashboard loads" instead of writing code. |
| **AI-Powered Test Generation**       | The AI generates robust, context-aware Playwright scripts by observing the live browser state and your instructions.                     |
| **Zero Data Exfiltration**           | Runs 100% locally — the browser automation and any data on the pages you visit never leave your machine.                                     |
| **Rapid Test Debugging**             | Ask the AI: "Why is this test failing?" — it will re-run the test, inspect elements, and analyze the page to diagnose the issue instantly.   |
| **Visual Testing & Screenshots**     | Automate visual checks. Command the AI to take screenshots of specific components or full pages for comparison and regression testing.       |
| **Stays in Your IDE**                | No context switching to a separate test runner or browser window. The AI handles everything in the background and returns results directly to your chat. |
| **Automated Test Maintenance**       | As your UI evolves, the AI can automatically refactor and update selectors in your test suites, dramatically reducing maintenance overhead. |
| **Free & Open-Source**               | Built entirely on the open-source Playwright framework. No licensing fees or vendor lock-in.                                               |
