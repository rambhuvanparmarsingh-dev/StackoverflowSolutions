# AI-Powered Test Agents: The Autonomous Testing Workflow

Playwright MCP introduces three specialized AI agents that automate the entire testing lifecycle:

| Agent      | Role             | Function                                                                                          |
|------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Planner**    | Test Strategist  | Explores your web application and produces a comprehensive test plan in Markdown format.        |
| **Generator**  | Test Developer   | Transforms the Markdown test plan into executable Playwright test files.                         |
| **Healer**     | Test Maintainer  | Executes the test suite and automatically repairs failing tests by updating selectors and logic.|

These agents can operate **independently**, **sequentially**, or in a **chained agentic loop** to deliver complete test coverage for your product with minimal human intervention.
