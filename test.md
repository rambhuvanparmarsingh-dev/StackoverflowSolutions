| **Natural Language Testing**         | Write tests in plain English: "Go to the login page, fill the credentials, and check if the dashboard loads" instead of writing code. |
| **Unified API + UI Testing**         | Seamlessly combine browser interactions with API calls in a single test workflow. Example: "Submit the form via UI and verify the data was created via API." |
| **AI-Powered Test Generation**       | The AI generates robust, context-aware Playwright scripts by observing the live browser state and your instructions.                     |
| **Zero Data Exfiltration**           | Runs 100% locally — browser automation and any data on the pages you visit never leave your machine.                                     |
| **Rapid Test Debugging**             | Ask the AI: "Why is this test failing?" — it will re-run the test, inspect elements, analyze console logs, and instantly diagnose the issue. |
| **Visual Testing & Screenshots**     | Automate visual checks. Command the AI to take screenshots of specific components or full pages for comparison and regression testing.       |
| **Stays in Your IDE**                | No context switching. The AI handles all automation in the background and returns results directly to your chat or editor.                     |
